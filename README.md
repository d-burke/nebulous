2-day hackathon Twitter clone webpage

## The Challenge ##
Given a data generator to simulate server posts, write a front end client to do the following: 
- single page dynamically rendering client. 
- displays all messages in chronological order.  
- allow user to see messages from one user by clicking on that users name. 
- user can post messages. 

## Additional Features ##
- messages display time posted in a easy to read way (i.e. 2min ago). 
- user controlled refresh. 
- Scroll back to top button. 

## Overachiever Feature: Create a Visual Design Theme ##
My Sci-fi Theme Details:
- title overlay opens like spaceship sheild curtains. 
- flying through space background. 
- webpage parts expand onto screen to give the impression of a computer monitor turning on. 
- messages have nebula colored glow outline based on user.
